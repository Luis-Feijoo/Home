<h2> All - Star Moves </h2>
<p>  From the East All - Stars, Kemba Walker was signed by the Boston Celtics in Free Agency for a 4 year, $141 Million deal.
Kyrie Irving who was on the Celtics signed for the Brooklyn Nets on a 4 year, $141 million deal as well. These two point guards
are some of the best in their conference and they look to lead their team to a new championship. D'Angelo Russell was another 
point guard that was in the Eastern Conference, but now moved to a team in the West. The young point guard was involved in a 
sign and trade deal that sent him to Golden State, 4 time winners in the last 5 years. He looks to win his first championship
and looks to replace the void of Klay Thompson, who has an injury that will keep him out for the season. Finally, Kawhi
Leonard signed for the LA Clippers in Free Agency after winning the Toronto Raptors' first championship. He inked a 3 year,
$103 million deal and looks to bring the LA Clippers their first championship. </p> 
<p> From the West All - Stars, Kevin Durant decided to sign with the Brooklyn Nets and join forces with Kyrie Irving after
4 successful years at Golden State. His contract is worth 4 years, $164 million and this is the first time he joins an
Eastern Conference team. He looks to bring Brooklyn its first championship with Kyrie and build a future dynasty. Durant's
former teammate Russell Westbrook was shipped off to Houston for Chris Paul. This ended his 11 year tenure at OKC and he joins
with his former teammate James Harden, as they look to win their first championship together after failed attempts. Anthony 
Davis left New Orleans in a humongous trade deal with the Lakers as he joins up with LeBron. They look to bring LA back to the
playoffs for the first time in 2013 and potentially winning a ring. Finally, Paul George got traded to the other LA team, the 
Clippers as he teams up with Kawhi Leonard. He looks to help Kawhi and the Clippers win their first championship and add a ring
to his already packed resume. </p>
