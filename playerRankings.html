		<h1 id = "Top"> <h1> Top 3 Players - Every Position </h1>

		<h2>Top 3 Point Guards</h2>
		
		<h3> 1. Steph Curry </h3>
		<img src = "images/curry.jpg" width = "200" height = "200" alt = "picture of curry">
		<p><cite> Image: Google Images</cite></p>
		<p> Curry has proven himself vastly in the league as probably the best shooter in the history of the game. His quick release
		and his brilliant vision of the game help contribute to his killer arsenal. He is capable of average 25/6/6 at his best and
		he always poses a threat to teams. As long as the injuries don't show up, he should lead the Warriors to another great year. 
		</p>
		
		<h3> <a href="AllstarMoves.html">2. Russell Westbrook</a> </h3>
		<img src = "images/russellwestbrook.jpg" width = "200" height = "200" alt = "picture of westbrook">
		<p><cite> Image: Google Images</cite></p>
		<p> Russ has always been an athletic freak and proves to be a very special player. He has all the capabilities a top point 
		guard, plus his amazing genes. He has the court vision, the slick dribbling and the ability to score in the paint. Although
		his shot may not be the best, he proves to be a danger for teams every night, consistently playing at a top level.
		
		<h3> 3. Damian Lillard </h3>
		<img src = "images/lillard.jpg" width = "200" height = "200" alt = "picture of lillard">
		<p><cite> Image: Google Images</cite></p>
		<p> Damian Lillard from a young age has always proved to be an offensive threat. He may not be the most athletic or very big,
		but he manages to ball out every night. He has a very deep shooting range, similar to Curry's and he can slither through the
		paint very easily. As long as he can lead Portland farther in the playoffs, he can start to move up the table as one of the
		greatest players in this modern era. </p>
		
		<h2>Top 3 Shooting Guards</h2>
		
		<h3> 1. James Harden </h3>
		<img src = "images/harden.jpg" width = "200" height = "200" alt = "picture of harden">
		<p><cite> Image: Google Images</cite></p>
		<p> James Harden is probably the sauciest player in the league, as he can display dominant nights on the offensive end and literally
		carry his team. He can score, pass, and even play some perimeter defense. He manages to get to the free throw line and help put points
		on the board. Unfortunately, he has not duplicated this success in the playoffs, but is definitely credited as a top player with his
		regular season success. </p>
		
		<h3> 2. DeMar Derozan </h3>
		<img src = "images/derozan.jpg" width = "200" height = "200" alt = "picture of derozan">
		<p><cite> Image: Google Images</cite></p>
		<p> DeMar DeRozan is definitely the coolest player in this list, as he resembles a player that isn't really aggressive, but shows 
		that scoring can be made with timing and patience. DeRozan is one of the best players in the post and is also very athletic, being 
		able to drive in the paint and make layups on contact. He isn't one to lead a team to a championship, but can definitely play a great
		role in supporting the success. </p> 
		
		<h3> 3. Klay Thompson </h3>
		<img src = "images/klay.jpg" width = "200" height = "200" alt = "picture of klay">
		<p><cite> Image: Google Images</cite></p>
		<p> Klay Thompson oozes class, and is a top player that contributes to his team in whatever way. He is one of the more unselfish players
		that can still put up 20-25 PPG. a game. This is due to his positioning on the court, his catch and shoot release and getting to the paint
		consistently making layups. Also, he is one of the top defensive players in the game which has helped the Warriors win championships and 
		cement his legacy. </p>
		
		<h2> Top 3 Small Forwards </h2>
		
		<h3> 1. LeBron James</h3>
		<img src = "images/lebron.jpg" width = "200" height = "200" alt = "picture of lebron">
		<p><cite> Image: Google Images</cite></p>
		<p> LeBron is arguably the best player of all time and definitely ranks at the number 1 spot in this list. He is able to do everything
		and carry his team, as seen with the Cavaliers. He can pass, shoot, drive, and do all sorts of things that impresses the crowd every 
		night as if he doesn't even try. He has proven himself in all of sorts of occasions, but if he really wants to cement his legacy, he
		has to bring a ring to L.A. like many other greats have done.</p>
		
		<h3> <a href="AllstarMoves.html">2. Kawhi Leonard</a> </h3>
		<p><cite> Image: Google Images</cite></p>
		<img src = "images/kawhileonard.jpg" width = "200" height = "200" alt = "picture of kawhi">
		<p> Kawhi is the best two-way player in the league as he can play both defense and offense at the top level. He has shown to be a classy
		player that can lead a team to success, as seen with the Raptors last season. He is literally the reincarnation of MJ in this era, as he
		shows a similar playstyle that can hurt teams every night. The challenge for Kawhi now is to keep up the consistency and if he is able to 
		bring the Clippers their first championship like he did with Toronto, he will truly have marked his spot in the Hall Of Fame. </p>
		
		<h3> <a href="AllstarMoves.html">3. Kevin Durant</a> </h3>
		<img src = "images/kevindurant.jpg" width = "200" height = "200" alt = "picture of kawhi">
		<p><cite> Image: Google Images</cite></p>
		<p> KD is definitely considered the best scorer in the NBA by many right now. He manages to use every offensive move to his advantage plus
		his sulking frame. He managed to help the Warriors win two championships and now moves to Brooklyn. This is the chance for him to prove 
		that he can lead a team with not as much all-star support. If he manages to bring Brooklyn a championship, he could potentially surpass 
		Kawhi and LeBron as the top player in the league.</p>
		
		<h2> Top 3 Power Forwards </h2>
		
		<h3> 1. Giannis Antetokounmpo </h3>
		<img src = "images/giannis.jpg" width = "200" height = "200" alt = "picture of giannis">
		<p><cite> Image: Google Images</cite></p>
		<p> Giannis is a young talent that has improved steadily over the years as each season goes by, he gets better. He has improved every 
		aspect of his game, even his shooting. He won MVP and lead the Bucks to 60 wins. Although he couldn't lead them to the Finals, he has
		the chance this season since the East has vastly weakened. Now that he has the experience in the playoffs, there is a great possibility
		that he can lead Milwaukee to their first Finals appereance since 1974 and stay at the top of this list. </p>
		
		<h3> <a href="AllstarMoves.html">2. Anthony Davis</a> </h3>
		<img src = "images/anthonydavis.jpg" width = "200" height = "200" alt = "picture of kawhi">
		<p><cite> Image: Google Images</cite></p>
		<p> AD has suffered through mediocrity over the course of his entire career, but now he has the chance to actually show his full potential
		as he gets to play with the Lakers. He has proven to be a top player on both ends and has always been in MVP talks. Unfortunately, he could
		not lead the Pelicans deeply in the playoffs, but now he's got that chance with LeBron and the Lakers. If he manages to not get injured and
		win a ring this season, there is a good chance he can get the  number one spot. </p>
		
		<h3> 3. Blake Griffin </h3>
		<img src = "images/griffin.jpg" width = "200" height = "200" alt = "picture of griffin">
		<p><cite> Image: Google Images</cite></p>
		<p> Griffin has managed to revive his career and get his A-game as he lead the Pistons to a playoff berth last season. He managed to star by
		doing his usual thing plus adding a shooting touch. He had a career year last season and managed to dazzle fans once again with his flashy
		game. If he manages to lead the Pistons to a deeper playoff run this season, he can manage to mark his reputation as one of the best modern
		PF's of this era.
		
		<h2> Top 3 Centers </h2>
		
		<h3> 1. Nikola Jokic </h3>
		<img src = "images/jokic.jpg" width = "200" height = "200" alt = "picture of jokic">
		<p><cite> Image: Google Images</cite></p>
		<p> Jokic manages to impress the crowd while being one of the most efficient players in the game. He manages to be a team player and get wins
		while putting up his abnormal stats. He lead Denver to a top two finish in the regular season, but couldn't help Denver past the Semi-Finals.
		Although, it was his first playoff appearance and now this season, we will see what he is really capable of and see if he can keep it up. He
		is the prototype for today's big men and manages to excel in every game he plays. </p>
		
		<h3> 2. Joel Embiid </h3>
		<img src = "images/embiid.jpg" width = "200" height = "200" alt = "picture of embiid">
		<p><cite> Image: Google Images</cite></p>
		<p> Embiid was an injury ridden player 3 years ago, but has now managed to become a top center in the league. The injuries still come and go, 
		but he manages to stuff the stat sheet with ridiculous games every night. He lead Philly to the playoffs once again, but couldn't make it past
		the eventual champion Raptors. Although, now that the East has gone down in level, he could possibly lead a great Philly team to the Finals and
		possibly become the next great foreign big man since Hakeem. </p>
		
		<h3> 3. Karl-Anthony Towns </h3>
		<img src = "images/towns.jpg" width = "200" height = "200" alt = "picture of kat">
		<p><cite> Image: Google Images</cite></p>
		<p> Although KAT has only made the playoffs once in his young stellar career, he still manages to be a top player in the league. He is capable of
		shooting the ball, whilst being an old-school big man that can bully his way in the paint. He and the Timberwolves look to improve from last season,
		but it's only a matter of hard work and determination that could possibly lead them to the playoffs. KAT has improved steadily each year and he can
		be the key player that could Minnesota to success for multiple years since the Garnett era.
