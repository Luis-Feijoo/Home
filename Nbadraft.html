		<h1 id = "Top"> <h1> Draft Overview </h1>
		<p> The NBA Draft allows teams that performed below expectations the past season to choose young top level talent coming
		from college. This is how NBA teams that are in the dump tend to rebuild themselves and become dynasties in the league.
		These young players look to join a team in the draft, as this is potentially what they make their living out of and they
		hope to shine on the top stage. This is the summer event that the whole world can witness who the next big superstar is
		going to be in the league.</p>
		
		<h1> Draft In 2019 </h1>
		<p> This year, there were many once in a generation talents that were up for grabs in the draft in which include Zion 
		Williamson, R.J Barrett and others. On the following list below, this shows the top 14 picks in the draft which is also
		known as the 'lottery round.' This also shows the team that they have been drafted to and what college they came 
		from. </p>

		<h1> Lottery Picks </h1>
	
		<h2> 1. Zion Williamson - New Orleans Pelicans - Duke</h2> 
		<img src = "images/zion.jpg" width = "150" height = "150" alt = "picture of zion"> 
		<p><cite> Images: Google Images</cite></p>
		<p> Zion is the perfect replacement for Anthony Davis since he departed to LA as he is able to become the new face of the 
		franchise. He is athletic and very fun to watch which could get New Orleans riveting once again and have something to be 
		hyped up for. </p>
		
		<h2> 2. Ja Morant - Memphis Grizzlies - Murray State</h2>
		<img src = "images/morant.jpg" width = "150" height = "150" alt = "picture of ja morant"> 
		<p><cite> Images: Google Images</cite></p>
		<p> Ja Morant manages to be a good replacement for Mike 
		Conley as the Grizzlies are in a rebuild. Ja is a very good player with all-star potential who could carry the franchise 
		in the future </p>
		
		<h2> 3. R.J. Barrett - New York Knicks - Duke</h2>
		<img src = "images/rjbarrett.jpg" width = "150" height = "150" alt = "picture of rj barrett"> 
		<p><cite> Images: Google Images</cite></p>
		<p> R.J. is obviously the best pick for the Knicks as they 
		have been lacking a star scorer recently. He can manage to bring the uproar back to New York once again and become a 
		future all-star. </p>
		
		<h2> 4. De'Andre Hunter - Atlanta Hawks - Virginia </h2>
		<img src = "images/hunter.jpg" width = "150" height = "150" alt = "picture of hunter"> 
		<p><cite> Images: Google Images</cite></p>
		<p> Hunter was definitely drafted right in his spot and can definitely
		help a young Hawks squad rise through the league. He is a great defensive player with top shooting skills and could 
		lead the Hawks to success for years to come. </p>
		
		<h2> 5. Darius Garland - Cleveland Cavaliers - Vanderbilt</h2>
		<img src = "images/garland.jpg" width = "150" height = "150" alt = "picture of garland"> 
		<p><cite> Images: Google Images</cite></p>
		<p> Garland is the perfect complement for Sexton as he is able to be a selfless
		player whilst putting up his numbers. Even though he had an injury, he managed to make it in the lottery round. </p>
		
		<h2> 6. Jarrett Culver - Phoenix Suns - Texas Tech</h2>
		<img src = "images/culver.jpg" width = "150" height = "150" alt = "picture of culver"> 
		<p><cite> Images: Google Images</cite></p>
		<p> Although Minnesota had many options to choose from, they chose Culver as he has proven to be a top shot-maker. 
		It was a safe pick made and it seems to be that he is going to be a very solid player. </p>
		
		<h2> 7. Coby White - Chicago Bulls - North Carolina</h2>
		<img src = "images/white.jpg" width = "150" height = "150" alt = "picture of white"> 
		<p><cite> Images: Google Images</cite></p>
		<p> The Bulls were in desperate need of a playmaker and White is able to provide that
		with high speed abilities. He can lead the offense at a high quality and could be a potential franchise cornerstone 
		for Chicago. </p>
		
		<h2> 8. Jaxson Hayes - New Orleans - Texas</h2>
		<img src = "images/hayes.jpg" width = "150" height = "150" alt = "picture of hayes"> 
		<p><cite> Images: Google Images</cite></p>
		<p> Although Hayes doesn't demonstrate a high level shooting ability, he manages to do
		everything else that is required of a big man. He has good height and a long wingspan,
		resulting in dunks and blocks for him every night. </p>
		
		<h2> 9. Rui Hachimura - Washington Wizards - Gonzaga</h2>
		<img src = "images/rui.jpg" width = "150" height = "150" alt = "picture of hachimura">
		<p><cite> Images: Google Images</cite></p>
		<p> Hachimura only started the sport a couple of years ago, but shows high potential. 
		He is able to shoot the ball consistently and has a big wingspan. He steadily improves 
		and is able to to fit in the league as a quality stretch-4. </p>
		
		<h2> 10. Cam Reddish - Atlanta Hawks - Duke</h2>
		<img src = "images/reddish.jpg" width = "150" height = "150" alt = "picture of reddish">
		<p><cite> Images: Google Images</cite></p>
		<p> Reddish at Duke always managed to disappear in most games as unfortunately he 
		could not find his shooting touch. He couldn't get shots inside and just can't manage to 
		reach his potential; but at this pick, there is still a chance for him to become a solid player. </p>
		
		<h2> 11. Cameron Johnson - Phoenix Suns - North Carolina</h2>
		<img src = "images/johnson.jpg" width = "150" height = "150" alt = "picture of johnson">
		<p><cite> Images: Google Images</cite></p>
		<p> It was a lucky time for Cameron Johnson as he managed to sneak into the lottery and
		no one expected him to be drafted this high. It seems to be that Phoenix aims for young talent, 
		but they could've chosen someone better. </p>
		
		<h2> 12. P.J. Washington - Charlotte Hornets - Kentucky</h2>
		<img src = "images/washington.jpg" width = "150" height = "150" alt = "picture of washington"> 
		<p><cite> Images: Google Images</cite></p>
		<p> PJ Washington could have been a draftee last offseason, but wanted to improve and
		work on his game. He did that and he managed to improve his stock by improving his shot and knowing how to create 
		space for himself. A solid pick by the Hornets who need big man shooters and PJ was the best one available.</p>
		
		<h2> 13. Tyler Herro - Miami Heat - Kentucky</h2>
		<img src = "images/herro.jpg" width = "150" height = "150" alt = "picture of herro"> 
		<p> Tyler Herro manages to excel in every offensive category as he can dribble, pass and shoot the
		ball all at a high quality. He even has good size and could potentially be known as a great shooter in the league. 
		Many think that he is just a shooter, but he is just a top scorer who deserved this spot in the draft. </p>
		
		<h2> 14. Romeo Langford - Boston Celtics - Indiana</h2>
		<img src = "images/langford.jpg" width = "150" height = "150" alt = "picture of langford"> 
		<p><cite> Images: Google Images</cite></p>
		<p> A bit surprising to see Langford drafted in the lottery, but the Celtics managed to draft him at 14. Unfortunately 
		for him, he won't have much of an impact as Boston already has a huge pool of young talent. Potentially though, 
		he could be a replacement for someone in the future and then prove himself in the NBA. </p>
