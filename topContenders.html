		<h1 id = "Top"> <h1> 8 Teams Who Could Win A Championship 2019-20 </h1>
		
		<h2> 8. Boston Celtics </h2>
		<h3> Starting 5 -- PG - Kemba Walker SG - Jaylen Brown SF - Gordon Hayward PF - Jayson Tatum C - Enes Kanter </h3>
		<img src = "images/celtics.jpg" width = "200" height = "200" alt = "picture of celtics logo">

		<p> The Celtics have underachieved under Brad Stevens and a team of great young players. Even with the acquisition of
		Kyrie Irving in  2017, the Celtics still haven't been able to make the Finals and have dissapointed in terms of 
		expectations. They did get Kemba Walker but the Celtics do lack size and a defensive presence outside of Marcus Smart
		and Enes Kanter. Unfortunately, due to the Celtics' past efforts, they will probably not be able to get past the 2nd
		round. </p>
		
		<h2> 7. Toronto Raptors </h2>
		<h3> Starting 5 -- PG - Kyle Lowry SG - Norman Powell SF - Pascal Siakam PF - Serge Ibaka C - Marc Gasol </h3>
		<img src = "images/raptors.jpg" width = "200" height = "200" alt = "picture of raptors logo">
		<p><cite> Images: Google Images</cite></p>
		<p> The Raptors just won the NBA Championship last June with Kawhi Leonard, Kyle Lowry and others helped the franchise
		win their first ring in 24 years. The Raptors eventually did lose Kawhi Leonard in free agency, but they have Lowry 
		and Siakam, two solid all-star caliber players. They also have a great bench led by Fred VanVleet, who balled out in
		the Finals. Although, the Raptors ultimately lack a top scorer and defensive beast, which could cost them in 
		the playoffs.</p>
		
		<h2> 6. Philadelphia 76ers </h2>
		<h3> Starting 5 -- PG - Ben Simmons SG - Josh Richardson SF - Tobias Harris PF - Al Horford C - Joel Embiid </h3>
		<img src = "images/sixers.jpg" width = "200" height = "200" alt = "picture of sixers logo">
		<p><cite> Image: Google Images</cite></p>
		<p> The Sixers are a very good team that just lack the playoff experience because they have only made the playoffs twice
		during the last 7 years. Although with Ben Simmons at the point and Embiid being the beast he is, the Sixers have a real
		chance this year as the East has weakened even more. The Raptors have lost their star player and the Celtics also lost 
		Kyrie. They have a real chance as long as the injury-prone Embiid doesn't catch a stop and the Sixers can mash their 
		renewed team together in time for May. </p>
		
		<h2> 5. Milwaukee Bucks </h2>
		<h3> Starting 5 -- PG - Eric Bledsoe SG - Wesley Matthews SF - Khris Middleton PF - Giannis Antetokounmpo C - Brook Lopez </h3>
		<img src = "images/bucks.jpg" width = "200" height = "200" alt = "picture of bucks logo">
		<p><cite> Image: Google Images</cite></p>
		<p> The Bucks were statistically the best team in the East last season. Although, they lacked the playoff
		experience that teams such as the Raptors had. They have a tall lineup with big men capable of shooting and going in
		the post. Even with the loss of Malcolm Brogdon, the Bucks still have a brilliant team led under a great coach known 
		for great offensive play. They have the MVP Giannis and they have a young core that can help him out vastly in 
		the playoffs; as they should be capable of making the ECF this season. </p>
		
		<h2> 4. Golden State Warriors </h2>
		<h3> Starting 5 -- PG - Steph Curry SG - D'Angelo Russell SF - Glenn Robinson III PF - Draymond Green C - Willie Cauley-Stein </h3>
		<img src = "images/warriors.jpg" width = "200" height = "200" alt = "picture of warriors logo">
		<p><cite> Image: Google Images</cite></p>
		<p> The Golden State Warriors have built a dynasty surrounding Steph Curry along with Klay Thompson and Draymond Green. They
		had brought Kevin Durant, a top player which eventually resulted in 2 rings. Now that Durant's gone, they have to fill the 
		scoring void. So they got D'Angelo Russell, a young promising PG with scoring abilities that is capable of filling in that
		void. Unfortunately, the Warriors have to play without Klay Thompson and fans are not too sure that D-Lo and Curry will mesh
		well in their first season. It is only a matter of hope and determination that can help the "Dubs" make it far in the playoffs. </p>
		
		<h2> 3. Houston Rockets </h2>
		<h3> Starting 5 -- PG - Russell Westbrook SG - James Harden SF - Eric Gordon PF - P.J. Tucker C - Clint Capela </h3>
		<img src = "images/rockets.jpg" width = "200" height = "200" alt = "picture of rockets logo">
		<p><cite> Images: Google Images</cite></p>
		<p> The Houston Rockets have always been lead to the playoffs with James Harden as the cornerstone of the franchise. Although, he
		has not been able to lead them to a championship either with Dwight Howard or Chris Paul. He gets another chance though, as he
		now teams up once again with 2017 MVP Russell Westbrook as his sidekick. They look to lead the Rockets to the NBA Finals, as they
		have not been able to reach that point since '95. They have a solid line-up filled with big men and shooters. The problem is that
		the chemistry between Harden and Westbrook might not flow very well, which could lead to ego issues in the locker room and on the 
		court.
		
		<h2> 2. LA Lakers </h2>
		<h3> Starting 5 -- PG - Rajon Rondo SG - Danny Green SF - LeBron James PF - Anthony Davis C - Dwight Howard </h3>
		<img src = "images/lalakers.jpg" width = "200" height = "200" alt = "picture of lakers logo">
		<p><cite> Images: Google Images</cite></p>
		<p> The Los Angeles Lakers are probably the most popular team in not just basketball or the U.S., but all over the world. They
		have not been able to replicate the success that Kobe, Shaq, and more helped bring to L.A. over this decade. But with LeBron
		and now AD after the trade, the Lakers seem to be top contenders once again. They have great depth, strong shooting, and 2 of
		the game's best players teaming up for nasty pick and rolls. They look to make the playoffs once again since 2013 and it seems
		possible with LeBron and AD leading the team, as they look to make it to the finals. They seem to also be a lock for the WCF as 
		well. </p>
		
		<h2> 1. LA Clippers </h2>
		<h3> Starting 5 -- PG - Patrick Beverley SG - Landry Shamet SF - Kawhi Leonard PF - Paul George C - Ivica Zubac </h3>
		<img src = "images/laclippers.jpg" width = "200" height = "200" alt = "picture of clippers logo">
		<p><cite> Images: Google Images</cite></p>
		<p> The Los Angeles Clippers were already a good team before they got two of the best small forwards in the game. They
		had taken the Golden State Warriors to 6 games in last season's playoffs with no all-stars. They now boast one of the
		best teams in the West with Kawhi Leonard and Paul George, and they have one of the best defensive teams in the league!
		The 2 MVP candidates should be able to lead a solid year for the Clippers, but as long as they don't get any injuries,
		considering the history; they should be an easy lock for the Conference Finals. </p>
